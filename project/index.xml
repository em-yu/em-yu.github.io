My goal was to build an interactive tool to grow organic looking surfaces. The outcome of this project was this live demo in the browser (you can try it) and some 3D prints!</description></item><item><title>Music and travel videos - Globeshakers Project</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/project/videos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:57:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/project/videos/</guid><description>I was very lucky to embark on a 6 months trip with a group of friends, during which we travelled the world and played music in the streets and bars, as a brassband. I was the reporter of the team, so I documented those precious moments, directed video clips and edited all of that into some videos.</description></item></channel></rss>
