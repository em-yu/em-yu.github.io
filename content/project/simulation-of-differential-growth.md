teaser: "growth-small.png"

summary: "Inspired by awesome generative artists such as [Nervous System](https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/) and [inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/), I built a web application simulating the penomenon of differential growth on a surface. My goal was to build an interactive tool to grow organic looking surfaces. The outcome of this project was this live demo in the browser (you can try it) and some 3D prints!"
