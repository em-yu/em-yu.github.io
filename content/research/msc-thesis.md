summary: "During my MSc thesis at DTU supervised by [Andreas BÃ¦rentzen](http://people.compute.dtu.dk/janba/), [Adrien Bousseau](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/) and [Tibor Stanko](https://tiborstanko.sk/), I implemented a VR sketching application in Unity and experimented with automatic neatening of strokes, formation of curve networks from the strokes, and infering surface patches. We finally conducted a small remote user study. This work was the basis for our next paper, CASSIE."
