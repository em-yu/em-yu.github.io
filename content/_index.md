title: "Emilie Yu - Post doctoral researcher"
---

I am a post doctoral researcher in the {{<link url="https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/">}}Expressive Computation Lab{{</link>}}&nbsp;supervised by Professor Jennifer Jacobs. I am interested in how people use technology and machines for artistic expression and crafts, and in questioning how computational methods can be useful to them. I explore this question through the design of software artifacts such as a desktop 2D frame-by-frame animation tool that uses 3D computer vision to align animated doodles with a video, or a VR painting application that adapts the well-known concepts of digital 2D layers to the 3D space.

I just completed a PhD at Inria Université Côte d'Azur in Dec 2023, where I worked in the {{<link url="https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/">}}GraphDeco team{{</link>}}&nbsp;supervised by {{<link url="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/">}}Adrien Bousseau{{</link>}}.
