I’m a 2nd year PhD student in {{<link url="https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/">}}GraphDeco team{{</link>}}&nbsp;at Inria in Nice, supervised by {{<link url="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/">}}Adrien Bousseau{{</link>}}. I graduated from {{<link url="https://www.dtu.dk/">}}DTU{{</link>}}&nbsp;(Technical University of Denmark) and {{<link url="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/">}}CentraleSupélec{{</link>}}&nbsp;in August 2020.
My research interests revolve around developing computational methods that are intertwined with user interactions, to make ill-posed problems tractable and provide control over the result. I am most interested in creativity tools, such as for 3D design, 3D painting or sketching.
In the summer of 2022, I'm interning at Adobe under the mentorship of Rubaiat Habib Kazi and Wilmot Li.

Aside of work, I enjoy photography and video editing, cycling and bouldering!
