I’m a 3rd (and last) year PhD student in {{<link url="https://team.inria.fr/graphdeco/">}}GraphDeco team{{</link>}}&nbsp;at Inria in Nice, supervised by {{<link url="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/">}}Adrien Bousseau{{</link>}}. I graduated from {{<link url="https://www.dtu.dk/">}}DTU{{</link>}} (Technical University of Denmark) and {{<link url="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/">}}CentraleSupélec{{</link>}}&nbsp;in August 2020.
My research interests revolve around developing computational methods that are intertwined with user interactions, to make ill-posed problems tractable and provide control over the result. I am most interested in creativity tools, such as for 3D design, 3D painting or sketching.
In the summer of 2022, I interned at Adobe Research under the mentorship of {{<link url="https://rubaiathabib.me/">}}Rubaiat Habib Kazi{{</link>}} and {{<link url="https://wilmotli.com/">}}Wilmot Li{{</link>}}.

These days, I am a visiting student at the University of Toronto supervised by {{<link url="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fchevali/fannydotnet/">}}Fanny Chevalier{{</link>}} and {{<link url="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~karan/">}}Karan Singh{{</link>}}.

Aside of work, I enjoy photography and video editing, cycling and bouldering!
