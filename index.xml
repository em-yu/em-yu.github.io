To support our workflow, we developed digitally fabricated connectors for easy assembly and disassembly, a custom pattern solver and user interface to guide garment design, and a visualization tool to help plan manual assembly and reassembly.</description></item><item><title>Our paper on modular crochet granny square garments has been conditionally accepted to DIS 2025!</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2025-04-dis-paper/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 11:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2025-04-dis-paper/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I served on the DIS Pictorials Committee.</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2025-02-dis-committee-copy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 11:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2025-02-dis-committee-copy/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I presented my dissertation work at the yearly French Computer Graphics conference JFIG 2024.</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2024-10-jfig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Oct 2024 11:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2024-10-jfig/</guid><description/></item><item><title>I served on the TEI Papers Committee.</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2024-08-tei/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 11:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/news/2024-08-tei/</guid><description/></item><item><title>3D-Layers: Bringing Layer-Based Color Editing to VR Painting</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/research/3dlayers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 11:26:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/research/3dlayers/</guid><description>VR artists create beautiful 3D paintings with colored 3D brushstrokes. We investigate how the paradigm of ``painting layers&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; could translate to the 3D painting space to achieve non-destructive color editing effects.</description></item><item><title>PhD Thesis: Designing Tools for 3D Content Authoring Based on 3D Sketching</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/research/phd-tesis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 18:56:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/research/phd-tesis/</guid><description>3D strokes: what are they? what can we use them for?</description></item><item><title>VideoDoodles: Hand-Drawn Animations on Videos with Scene-Aware Canvases</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/research/videodoodles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 14:26:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/research/videodoodles/</guid><description>We study how artists create VideoDoodles (mix of video and hand-drawn animation) and propose a novel user interface to simplify this task based on depth and motion priors.</description></item><item><title>Piecewise-Smooth Surface Fitting onto Unstructured 3D Sketches</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/research/surfacing_3d_sketches/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2022 14:26:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/research/surfacing_3d_sketches/</guid><description>We propose a method to transform unstructured 3D sketches into piecewise smooth surfaces that preserve sketched geometric features.</description></item><item><title>CASSIE: Curve And Surface Sketching in Immersive Environments</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/research/cassie/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 14:26:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/research/cassie/</guid><description>We prototype a 3D sketching interface in VR, where the user&amp;rsquo;s strokes are automatically neatened to form a well-connected curve network. We additionnaly infer and create surface patches on the sketch, making it possible to create a 3D surface from a few 3D brush strokes.</description></item><item><title>MSc Thesis: Interactive 3D Sketching in Virtual Reality</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/research/msc-thesis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 18:56:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/research/msc-thesis/</guid><description>During my MSc thesis at DTU supervised by &lt;a href="http://people.compute.dtu.dk/janba/">Andreas BÃ¦rentzen&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Adrien.Bousseau/">Adrien Bousseau&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://tiborstanko.sk/">Tibor Stanko&lt;/a>, I implemented a VR sketching application in Unity and experimented with automatic neatening of strokes, formation of curve networks from the strokes, and infering surface patches. We finally conducted a small remote user study. This work was the basis for our next paper, CASSIE.</description></item><item><title>Simulation of Differential Growth</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/project/simulation-of-differential-growth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2019 19:49:38 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/project/simulation-of-differential-growth/</guid><description>Inspired by awesome generative artists such as &lt;a href="https://n-e-r-v-o-u-s.com/">Nervous System&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://inconvergent.net/">inconvergent&lt;/a>, I built a web application simulating the penomenon of differential growth on a surface. My goal was to build an interactive tool to grow organic looking surfaces. The outcome of this project was this live demo in the browser (you can try it) and some 3D prints!</description></item><item><title>Voxel Editor</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/project/voxel-editor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Dec 2018 20:10:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/project/voxel-editor/</guid><description>For the final project of DTU course 02561 Computer graphics, we set out to build a simple voxel editor. This is a Javascript/WebGL project, with a pretty barebone UI. My favorite part was working on the picking interaction for creation and deletion of voxels.</description></item><item><title>Music and travel videos - Globeshakers Project</title><link>https://em-yu.github.io/project/videos/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:57:50 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://em-yu.github.io/project/videos/</guid><description>I was very lucky to embark on a 6 months trip with a group of friends, during which we travelled the world and played music in the streets and bars, as a brassband. I was the reporter of the team, so I documented those precious moments, directed video clips and edited all of that into some videos.</description></item></channel></rss>
